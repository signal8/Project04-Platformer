# BINGUS ADVENTURE 7
Rushed platformer project, started on March 7th, completed March 9th.

You are Bingus, and you are trying to get to the other side of Cave Fingledoof without dying from the EepyHeads and Bombs.

## Implementation
 - Camera that is bounded to the level
 - 100% Original Art
 - 100% Original Sound and Music
 - An Enemy that moves vertically
 - An Enemy that hones in on the player, using a lerp to move smoothly.
 - A lot of scrapped features, lol
